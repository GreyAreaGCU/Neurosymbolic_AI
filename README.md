# Neurosymbolic_AI

## AGI inspired by the human brain

Combining logic with deep learning requires sparse representations with a concept of firing or not firing, both features found in the more complex neurons of the human brain vs the simplifications present in deep learning.

The aim of this project is to explore what I believe to be the underlying paradigms allowing the neurons of the human brain to qualify as AGI. These are

-sparse non-interferring representations allowing few shot learning

-recurrent two way connections/communication

-multiscale patterns of connections and corresponding multiscle timescales of action relating to the complexity of information

-oscillatory phenomena with frequancy coupling between different regions allowing the persistence of transient information and facilitating the communication between different brain regions

-stochasticity allowing breakout from local minima and pushing weaker associations over a threshold of being made

This will be an attempt to build these paradigms on top of the latest research in neuroscience regarding the structure and format of various neurons in a way that a working neurosymbolic AI can be part designed and part evolved/trained.

The architecture of this project will be monitoring/evolution/run classes (python) -> builder classes (python) -> performant backend C++ where the arrows indicate abstraction/dependency
